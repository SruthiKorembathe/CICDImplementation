This is an example **sidebar** for your GitHub wiki (GitHub by default shows
this on the right top of all wiki pages).
By default GitHub simply lists your pages in alphabetical order.

This side bar is named `_Sidebar.md` in the source files when you clone the
wiki, or you can use the "crayon" to edit in the UI.

Use `[[Page title]]` with double brackets when referencing pages here in the
sidebar or elsewhere in your wiki pages.

> [!NOTE]
> Delete all of the above but keep the below explanation to users on how to
> use the "Pages" UI control.

When you start with the "Wiki" option in GitHub at the top, it takes you to
the "Home" page.
You can always use the "Pages" UI control above the sidebar ‚òù to navigate
to any pages not here, or to navigate the table of contents for a page.
