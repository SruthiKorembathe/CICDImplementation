This is an example **sidebar** for your GitHub wiki (GitHub by default shows
this on the right top of all wiki pages).
By default GitHub simply lists your pages in alphabetical order.

This side bar is named `_Sidebar.md` in the source files when you clone the
wiki, or you can use the "crayon" icon to edit in the UI.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use the "Wiki" option on GitHub's top bar, it takes you to the
> "Home" page (`Home.md`): you cannot rename this page, and GitHub uses the
> page name for the title at the page top.

Use `[[some page title]]` with double brackets when referencing pages here in
the sidebar or elsewhere in your wiki pages.
And use the `#`, `##`, etc. style in Markdown to format the sidebar.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Delete this callout and all of the above, but keep the below explanation
> to help new readers use the "Pages" UI control.

You can always use the "Pages" UI control above this sidebar ☝  to navigate
around all pages alphabetically (even pages not in this sidebar), to navigate
the outline for each page, or for a search box.

> [!NOTE]
> Markdown works in sidebars, such as headings (`#`, `##`, etc) to organize
> structure in the sidebar, illustrated below.
