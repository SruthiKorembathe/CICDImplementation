> Welcome to the wiki-docs wiki!

The above is the default starting content when you use the "wiki" feature in
GitHub.

## Sample pages

* [[Template REST API]]
* [[Template JSON Models]]

## Working with the wiki locally with your machine

You can clone the wiki: it is a repo in GitHub.
For this project, the clone URL is:
<git@github.com:binkley/wiki-docs.wiki.git>.<br/>
Note the ".wiki" added after your code repo URL.

I like to edit the wiki locally, and take advantage of my IDE (such as
[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/markdown.html) or
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown)) and the
command line, but it is up to you what works best.

### Commit messages

When you edit in the GitHub UI, the default commit message look like:

> Updated Home (markdown)

You can give a commit message in the UI at the bottom of the page:<br/>
![image](https://github.com/binkley/wiki-docs/assets/186421/e6ec089f-cc8e-4ab6-843a-a2daeacf41fa)

And you can always give a meaningful commit message when working locally!

## Adding images and screenshots

I add images by editing with the GitHub UI for the wiki and pasting.
The UI automatically uploads the image, and inserts a link for you.
I am unsure how to do this locally with the cloned repo.

## The right-hand navigation sidebar

When you edit the Sidebar in the UI, use the crayon icon:<br/>

If you customize the sidebar, you can still find all pages&mdash;even those
you did not list:<br/>

Locally edit the `_Sidebar.md` file in your repo clone if you customize the sidebar.
