Welcome to the wiki-docs wiki!

The above is the default starting content when you use the "wiki" feature in
GitHub.

Note the `_Sidebar.md` file if you customize the right-hand bar in GitHub's
wiki pages, and clone the wiki.
(I added the below image by editing with the GitHub UI for the wiki, and
pasting.
It automatically uploaded the image, and gave me a link here to display it
to you.)
