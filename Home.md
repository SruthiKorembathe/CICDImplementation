> Welcome to the wiki-docs wiki!

The above is the default starting content when you use the "wiki" feature in
GitHub.

## Sample pages

* [[Template REST API]]
* [[Template JSON Models]]

## Working with the wiki locally

You can clone the wiki: it is a repo in GitHub.

When you edit in the GitHub UI, commit message look like:

> Updated Home (markdown)

## Adding images and screenshots

I add images by editing with the GitHub UI for the wiki and pasting.
The UI automatically uploads the image, and inserts a link for you.
I am unsure how to do this locally with the cloned repo.

## The right-hand navigation sidebar

When you edit the Sidebar in the UI, use the crayon icon:<br/>

If you customize the sidebar, you can still find all pages&mdash;even those
you did not list:<br/>

Locally edit the `_Sidebar.md` file in your repo clone if you customize the sidebar.
