> Welcome to the wiki-docs wiki!

The above is the default starting content when you use the "wiki" feature in
GitHub.

## Sample pages

* [[Template REST API]]
* [[Template JSON Models]]

## The right-hand navigation sidebar

Note the `_Sidebar.md` file if you customize the right-hand bar in GitHub's
wiki pages, and clone the wiki.
(I added the below image by editing with the GitHub UI for the wiki, and
pasting.
It automatically uploaded the image, and inserted a link to the uploaded
image.)
